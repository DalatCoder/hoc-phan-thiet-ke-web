  <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
  <p>
    This week I am <em>extremely </em> excited about a new cooking technique
    called <dfn> <i>sous vide</i> </dfn> . In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you
    submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that
    is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked
    to. In his book,<cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as
    <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next month, we will be serving 
    <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the
    chef table, contact us before November 30.

    Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are
    pregnant or have immunity issues.
